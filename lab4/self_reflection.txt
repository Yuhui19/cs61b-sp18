All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: More helper function.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: At lease, it works.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I have many many if statement to avoid corner cases which I should do better next time.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Something.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: No.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would think more deeply to avoid corner cases instead of just rely on gradescope.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I think double linked node is cool, better than single linked node, but of course, harder.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: It works.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I think my linked list deque is good.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: No.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: No.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: No.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Good. Gradescope is perfect.
